<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project:  
<p>The nft utility industry has enjoyed some incredible success, however it suffers greatly with respect to tracking and communicating important brand utilities associated to nft collections. Imagine a person with hundreds of nfts that have ongoing utility ranging from physical, experiential and/or digital utility. How could someone keep up with all the redemptions offered with each nft?

Nexum solves this problem with a  two-ended solution. The first being an organized approach for any brand or creator to create and track utility against any collection and its respective community. Imagine a brand creator knowing who their most influential community members are thus allowing them to further incentivize their prowess? 

From a community standpoint, Nexum eliminates the need to run to discord, twitter or other social platforms to find out the status of your utilities. It‚Äôs a hub that  tethers together and organizes your utilities across various collections by providing reminders, updates and notification so you never miss a V.I.P event or important date. </p>

## üé¨ Live Demo of [Nexum][Nexum-url]
Check out the live demo of [Nexum][Nexum-url], deployed on the Flow Testnet. The demo involves the creator attaching a physical utility to their collection. The creator can also utilize the NBA Top Shot contract, which has been cloned for demo purposes only. Currently, the platform allows for attaching a physical utility and creating a claim page. Those who are part of the collection can then claim the utility.

 
## Main System Components:
* **Cloud Flare**: Cloud flare may be used to have easy access to HTTPS and a certificate, and also to prevent DDOS.
* **Web Servers**: Are the list of web servers that run the Bloomly web application and serve user HTTP requests.
* **Cache**: A cache is used to store frequently requested data. All data that is changed has to have its corresponding cached data invalidated.
* **Relational Database**: Stores all data that is non-critical, and also serves as a persistent ‚Äúsecond layer‚Äù caching mechanism for data stored inside the blockchain.  All data changed in the blockchain has to have its corresponding copy in the database updated.
* **Blocto Cloud Wallet**: Stores user data and user private keys. 
* **CDN**: Stores images for quicker retrieval. 
* **Cloud S3 Bucket**: Stores images and data with redundancy.
